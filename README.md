cout<<endl<<"Game Overview"<<endl;
  cout<<"Description
  \nYou gain points when you ROLL a die. You can roll the die multiple times on your turn. Each time you roll, your die number gets added to your temporary turn total. However, if you roll a 1, you lose all your turn total points and it's the other player's turn. 
  If you want to keep your points, you must choose to HOLD-- this adds your turn total points to your permanent grand total, resets your turn total, and forfeits your turn to the other player. The player who reaches 100 grand total points first, wins. 
  You can RESIGN (to start a new game) or QUIT (to end the program) anytime while it is your turn and the program is running."<<endl;
